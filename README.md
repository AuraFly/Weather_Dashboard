# Weather_Dashboard
This sixth homework assignment has me creating a weather dashboard using third-party API's.


- The motivation for myself is to demonstrate what I have learned over the last month and demonstrate that I have built on my ability to use fetch requests and can utilize third party apis.
- Through this assignment I became much more familiar with bootstrap once again, and also of course using fetch requests and apis in different ways.
- Overall I dont think the assignment was too hard, however projects started the same week that this assignment was being worked on so I found myself strapped for time. I will come back to this project and add finishing touches after projects are complete.
